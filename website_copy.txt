### Web Development

- The General Store (E-com): Sell your goods. A reliable, secure shopfront that handles the heavy lifting so you can focus on making your products.

- The Map Maker (GBP): We’ll polish your Google Business Profile until it shines, making you the obvious choice on the local map.

## 5. PHILOSOPHY (THE MINDSET)
- Main Heading: Honest Tech.
- Story: RezTek Digital started because we were tired of the "disruptive" tech bros. We prefer the "reliable" approach. We treat web design like a craft—like woodworking or fixing up a classic car. We use modern tools to build things that feel timeless.
- We’re a remote-first crew of digital nomads who value a handshake (even over Zoom) and a job well done. We don’t hide behind bots; we’re just real people building better tools for the bold.
- No Bloat: If you don't need it, we won't build it.
- Performance is Politeness: A slow site is rude to your customers. We make sure yours is lightning fast.
